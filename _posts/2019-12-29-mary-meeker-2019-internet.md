title: Mary Meeker 的 2019 年网络报告
tags: blog
---

作为教母级别的 Mary 每年大概六月都会分享一份互联网报告。今年的这份，我到了年底才有时间消化。一共 333 页的报告，信息量很大。原稿可以在[这里][report]看到。Vox 做了比较好的整理，作为学习，我也作为读后感翻译一下。


* 去年（2018）全世界大概有 51% 的人口已经能使用到网络，人数是38亿。2017年的数据是49亿。增长率是放缓了，目前大概是 6% 。主要原因应该是能上的都已经上了，新用户增长率放缓。 同时智能手机的销售也大幅度缓了下来。这也是预期之中，毕竟市场已经饱和。<!--more-->

* 以 2019 年 5 月的数据，全球市值前十名的公司中，之后巴菲特的 Berkshire Hathaway，Visa，还有强生 Johnson & Johnson 是非互联网或技术公司。其它七家分别是微软，亚马逊，苹果，谷歌Alphabet，Facebook，阿里巴巴，腾讯。

* 全球零售现在有15%是电子商务。增长还是有的，虽然缓慢了很多。 拿 2019 年第一季度的数据来说，增长是 12% 。这比起传统零售的 2% ，势头还是可以的。

* 美国的网络广告在 2018 年涨了 22% 。大部分是在谷歌和 Facebook 上。但 Twitter 和亚马逊的增长势头也不小。 62% 的购买是 [programmatic ads][wikiad] - 这里可以理解为基于点击和流量的自动化定价广告。（iFeng评论：估计 2019 的美国选举会把这个数字推得更高。比如候选人之一的 Mike Bloomberg 就[花了不少][mike]）。

* 获取新用户的成本在增长。这个是否可以长期持续下去就不得而知了。有些获新成本甚至比用户未来能带来的长期利润还低。Meeker 觉得应该有更好的方法获取用户，比如免费使用或是把服务分成免费版和收费版。

* 网络广告业这两年也受到挺大的打击。比如欧洲的信息保护法令 [GDPR][gdpr] (General Data Protection Regulation) 和其它相关的条例。

There are a number of problems ahead for targeted advertising, including GDPR impact and other regulation, as well as pushes for more privacy from hardware and software companies like Apple and Facebook.

Americans are spending more time with digital media than ever: 6.3 hours a day in 2018, up 7 percent from the year before. Most of that growth is coming from mobile and other connected devices, while time spent on computers declines. People are also getting more concerned about time spent online, as more than a quarter of US adults say they’re “almost constantly online.”
Innovation at tech companies outside the US has remained robust. Popular areas include fulfillment, delivery, and payments.
Images are increasingly the means by which people communicate, as technology developments like faster wifi and better phone cameras have encouraged a surge in image taking. More than 50 percent of Twitter impressions now involve posts with images, video or other media; Twitter used to be text-only.
The number of interactive gamers worldwide grew 6 percent to 2.4 billion people last year, as interactive games like Fortnite become the new social media for certain people. The number of people who watch those games — rather than participate — is swelling, too.
As privacy becomes a bigger selling point, expect more options to make your online communications safe. In Q1, 87 percent of global web traffic was encrypted, up from 53 percent three years ago.
The internet will become more of a cesspool: Getting rid of problematic content becomes more difficult on a large scale, and the very nature of internet communication allows that content to be amplified much more than before. Some issues: 42 percent of US teens have experienced offensive name-calling online, terrorists are being radicalized on sites like YouTube, and social media has encouraged increased political polarization.
Of the top 25 most valuable tech companies, 60 percent were founded by first- or second-generation immigrants. They employed 1.9 million people last year. New stricter immigration laws could negatively impact the tech industry and perhaps prevent our next Elon Musk from getting to the US.
Health care is steadily becoming more digitized. Expect more telemedicine and on-demand consultations.
